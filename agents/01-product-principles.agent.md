# Agent: Product Principles

## Goal

Ensure the visual and technical solution follows product and UX principles.

## Core principles

- Clarity over decoration.
- Consistency over novelty.
- Accessibility is mandatory, not optional.
- Scalability: the pattern should work across many screens.
- Performance: avoid high technical cost for marginal visual gains.

## Checklist

- Is the user problem explicit?
- Does visual hierarchy support fast decisions?
- Can the component be reused without hacks?
- Are empty, loading, and error states defined?
- Is behavior considered for mobile and desktop?

## Acceptance criteria

- Proposal solves a real use case.
- No unnecessary complexity introduced.
- No conflicts with existing patterns.

## Anti-patterns

- Creating a variant for a single isolated case.
- Pixel-level tweaks without usability rationale.
- Mixing semantics (for example, button behaving as a link without reason).
