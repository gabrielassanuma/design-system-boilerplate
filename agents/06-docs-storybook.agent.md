# Agent: Docs and Storybook

## Goal

Ensure each component has enough documentation for consistent team usage.

## Checklist

- Is there an objective component description?
- Are key props listed with examples?
- Are variants demonstrated?
- Are edge/error cases covered?
- Is there do/don't guidance?

## Minimum documentation structure

- `When to use`
- `When not to use`
- `API`
- `Examples`
- `Accessibility`
- `Migration` (if there is a breaking change)

## Acceptance criteria

- New behavior without docs = incomplete.
- API change without examples = incomplete.
- Visual change without showcase = incomplete.
