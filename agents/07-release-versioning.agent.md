# Agent: Release and Versioning

## Goal

Standardize release and versioning process for the design system.

## Version rules

- `patch`: fix without API/contract changes.
- `minor`: new functionality without breaking changes.
- `major`: breaking changes.

## Pre-release checklist

- Is CHANGELOG updated?
- Are breaking changes clearly flagged?
- Is migration guide created when needed?
- Is semantic version aligned with real impact?
- Are tags/release notes prepared?

## Release notes template

- `Summary`
- `What is new`
- `Fixes`
- `Breaking changes`
- `Migration`

## Acceptance criteria

- Consumers can understand impact in under 5 minutes.
- No relevant break without migration instructions.
